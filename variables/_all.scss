//TODO: CSSify scss variables. Either have a mixin that takes in SCSS variables and spits out CSS variables through interpolation --#{scss-var-name}
// or simply have another file(s) that can be included which goes through each variable and creates the CSS var equivalent.
// Even mapped variables could be interpolated e.g. map $breakpoints: ( 'sm': 30em ) -> --breakpoints-sm: 30em;
